# Personal Income: Per Capita Income for U.S. Counties 2019

The project aims to create a map which shows per capita income for counties in U.S. in 2019. 

* Per capita income is the measure of the amount of money earned per person in a given area. 
It can be interpreted as the average per-person income and is a useful indicator for the standard of living and quality of life of the population. 
It takes the total gross domestic product (GDP) of a county and divides it by the number of people in the county. GDP is the income generated by all residents and businesses in the county. 

* Areas with higher levels of income are shaded darker in the map. 

* Income data is missing for some counties and interpretation is limited to the dataset used in the project. 
		
## Data and Tools Used in the Project
* Per capita income is obtained from U.S. [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=6)
* Geographical data sourced from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/).
* QGIS 3.16 is used to create the map.
