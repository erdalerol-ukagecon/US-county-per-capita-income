# Personal Income: Per Capita Income for U.S. Counties 2019

The project aims to create a map which shows per capita income for counties in U.S. 

* Per capita income is a measure of the amount of money earned per person in a county. 
It can be interpreted as the average per-person income and is a useful indicator for the standard of living and quality of life of the population.
Areas with higher levels of income are shaded darker.

* Teton county in Wyoming has the highest average incomes per capita of any county in the United States, at $229,825. This is partly attributed to the high incomes of Jackson Hole residents, where property owners include Bill Gates. 

* Newyork (Newyork), Pitkin (Colorado) and Bristol Bay (Alaska) are the other highest-income counties.
		
## Data and Tools Used in the Project
* Per capita income is obtained from U.S. [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=6)
* Geographical data sourced from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/).
* QGIS 3.16 is used to create the map.
