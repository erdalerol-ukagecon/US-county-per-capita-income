# Personal Income: Per Capita Income for U.S. Counties 2019

The project aims to create a map which shows per capita income for counties in U.S. 

Per capita income is a measure of the amount of money earned per person in a county. 
It can be interpreted as the average per-person income and is a useful indicator for the standard of living and quality of life of the population.
Areas with higher levels of income are shaded darker.

Teton county in Wyoming has the highest average incomes per capita of any county in the United States, at $229,825. This is partly attributed to the high incomes of Jackson Hole residents, where property owners include Bill Gates. Newyork (Newyork), Pitkin (Colorado) and Bristol Bay (Alaska) are the other highest-income counties.
